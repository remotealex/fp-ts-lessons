# Functional programming in TypeScript

For years I wanted to learn FP, but many attempts left me confused an sad :(

This time it was going to be different. I was going to do my homework, study hard and concur fp once and for all.

I stumbled upon [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) and as an avid TS users, I knew this was going to be my lib.

This repo contains my "lessons" from the small but mighty [learning resources](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/learning-resources/) and docs for fp-ts.

I love talking about this stuff and so if you want to learn together or need help with anything, please just make an issue or something :)

## Running the lessons

All of the _lessons_ are runnable. Just clone the repo, run `yarn` to install TS and `fp-ts` etc. Then run `ts-node ./lesson-1.ts` to run the script.
